# azel-moontracker
A simple shellscript that helps to track 
the Moon for EME Hamradio purposes.


azel-moontracker is a simple shellscript that
reads the azel.dat file written by WSJT or
other compatible programs.

It then uses rotctl as provided by hamlib to
automatically track the Moon with your antennas
for EME - Earth-Moon-Earth contacts.

Of course you still need an EME capable Hamradio
setup with radios, antennas, amplifiers and (!!)
a hamlib compatible rotor/controller combination.


To configure your setup you have to edit the
azel-moontracker file. Just run it afterwards to
start tracking.


Have fun and good DX!
