# azel-moontracker
A simple shellscript that helps to track 
the Moon for EME Hamradio purposes.


azel-moontracker is a simple shellscript that
reads the azel.dat file written by WSJT or
other compatible programs.

It then uses rotctl as provided by hamlib to
automatically track the Moon with your antennas
for EME - Earth-Moon-Earth contacts.

Of course you still need a capable EME Hamradio
setup with radios, antennas, amplifiers and (!!)
a hamlib compatible rotor/controller combination.

Have fun and good DX!
